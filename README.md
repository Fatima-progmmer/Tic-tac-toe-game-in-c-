# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C++

## Project Overview
This project is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using C++. It allows two players to take turns placing their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game results in a draw.

## Features
- Two-player mode
- User-friendly interface in the terminal
- Detects win conditions and draws
- Simple and efficient C++ implementation

## How to Play
1. Run the program in a terminal.
2. Players take turns entering their move by selecting a grid position (1-9).
3. The game checks for a winner after each move.
4. The game ends when a player wins or all positions are filled (draw).

## How to Compile and Run
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler:
   ```sh
   g++ tic_tac_toe.cpp -o tic_tac_toe
   ```
2. Run the compiled program:
   ```sh
   ./tic_tac_toe
   ```
